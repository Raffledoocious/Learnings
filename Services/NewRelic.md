APM
    Application performance monitoring, real time data tracking
    Seems like everything from metrics, events, logs, and transactions (MELT)
    Store logs, automatically ingested

MELT
    Metric
        Numeric measurement of a software application, aggregated or moment in time are common
        Hard to do detailed analysis of older data since aggregation may have occurred
    Event
        Things that occur, like a server setting being changed, website click
        Detailed analysis of events so you can dig in
    Log
        Message from the system
    Transaction
        Distributed tracing in the microservices world, how an action moves through the system
        How to report various ways a system operates
